		<p class="main-text-format" style="font-weight: bold">
			How do I sign up for a class?
		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format" style="margin-bottom: 25px">
			To register online, click on 'Login/Register' in the top right hand corner.  On the Login page, click on 'New Account'.  Enter your information in the fields provided and click 'Continue' at the bottom. 		
		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format" style="margin-bottom: 25px">
			Once logged in, click 'Find A Class' on the left to see the class schedule.  Use the drop-down filters to adjust which classes are shown.  Click 'Submit Request' next to your chosen class to register.  You will receive a confirmation email when we've processed your request.  If you do not receive a confirmation within two business days please call or email to confirm that your request was received.		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format" style="margin-bottom: 25px">
			You may also register by calling the gym at 608-834-1444 or emailing <a class="primary-link" href="mailto:info@flipcity.biz">info@flipcity.biz</a>.  We will need your first and last name, your child's first and last name, your address, your phone number, and your child's date of birth.  A waiver must be signed on or before the first day of class by a legal parent or guardian.		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format" style="font-weight: bold">
			What should students wear to class?
		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format" style="margin-bottom: 25px">
Leotards are strongly recommended.  Tight athletic shorts over the leotard are optional.  Other tight fitting athletic attire will be permitted if it allows for proper skill spotting.  Students should not wear skirts, jewelry, buttons, zippers, or socks. Gymnastics shoes are permitted.  Team gymnasts are required to wear leotards.</p>
		<p class="main-text-format" style="font-weight: bold">
			Do you offer a trial class?
		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format" style="margin-bottom: 25px">
			Yes. Students may attend one class before enrolling.  Signing up for a trial class will not hold a spot for your child at that particular class time.  To reserve a spot, please register for the class.  If you decide to discontinue enrollment within 3 class sessions, we will refund tuition paid.
		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format" style="font-weight: bold">
			What are the fees for classes?
		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format"  style="margin-bottom: 25px">
			We charge a monthly tuition.  For class tuition prices please visit the 'Classes' tab and click the pink 'Schedule & Pricing' button.			
		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format"  style="margin-bottom: 25px">
<u>The first and last month's tuition are due at the time of registration.</u>  Thereafter, tuition is due by the first class of the month.  At least 30 days prior to discontinuing a class, please notify us in writing or via email.  We will then apply your last month's tuition to the last month your child will be attending.		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format"  style="margin-bottom: 25px">
You can make payment at the gym or through your Flip City online account.  If you don't have an account yet, click 'Login/Register' in the top right hand corner.  On the Login page, click on 'New Account'.		</p>
		
		<p class="main-text-format" style="font-weight: bold">
			What if I forget to notify the gym that my child will be discontinuing class?
		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format"  style="margin-bottom: 25px">
If your child doesn't attend class and we have not received payment after the second class of the month, we will apply your last month's tuition and drop the student from the class at the end of the month.  In case your child was unable to attend class and payment was forgotten, but you want to continue the class, please make the full month's tuition payment along with a $15 late fee.  Note: Your student's spot in that particular class time will not be guaranteed the following month if payment is two weeks late or more. 		</p>
		
		<p class="main-text-format" style="font-weight: bold">
			Do you have trampolines?
		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format"  style="margin-bottom: 25px">
			No. To save space and lessen insurance costs, we invested in the Weller Spring Floor instead of trampolines.
		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format"  style="margin-bottom: 25px">
			Trampolines are often used in gymnastics training to allow for more skill repetitions without the damaging impact on the joints of the older types of spring floors.  The Weller Spring floor, however, has been shown to not cause the chronic joint injuries typical of a standard spring floor.  This allows us to practice necessary skill repetitions on our floor, with mats as needed.  Learn more about the Weller Spring floor at <a class="primary-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wellerspring.com">wellerspring.com</a> or <a class="primary-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/WellerSpringFloor">facebook.com/WellerSpringFloor</a>.		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format"  style="margin-bottom: 25px">
			We agree that trampolines are super fun and will probably incorporate them in the future.  At this point, the increased risk and space needs have impacted our decision to hold off.		
		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format" style="font-weight: bold">
			Do you have foam pits?
		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format"  style="margin-bottom: 25px">
No.  Due to the increased risk, required maintenance, and resources needed to construct a pit, we have chosen not to incorporate them at this time.		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format"  style="margin-bottom: 25px">
Foam pits can be great for teaching advanced competitive gymnastics.  However, they pose significant risk when placed in an area used by younger students.  Children often think it is similar to a swimming pool and attempt front-facing entries such as bellyflops.  This can cause hyper extension of the back or other injuries.  Another common occurrence is students digging holes in a foam pit.  Often a student will accidentally or intentionally jump into the hole, risking hitting the bottom of the pit or causing an avalanche of foam, temporarily trapping students underneath.		<p class="main-text-format"  style="margin-bottom: 25px">
		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format"  style="margin-bottom: 25px">
Foam pits are also extremely difficult to keep clean.  The spaces in a cube of foam trap sweat and bacteria.  They also grab onto socks, band aids, and other loose items, collecting them at the bottom.
		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format"  style="margin-bottom: 25px">
With our current program offerings of recreational, preschool, and girls' competitive Levels 1-5, a foam pit would require more risk, maintenance, and resources than it is worth.  As our students advance to the higher levels, we will expand and incorporate foam pits as we see necessary.  		</p>
<p class="main-text-format" style="font-weight: bold">
			When will the gym close due to weather?
		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format"  style="margin-bottom: 25px">
Flip City Gymnastics classes and events will be canceled when the Sun Prairie schools close, release students early, or cancel evening events due to weather. Please check our home page for cancellation information.		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format" style="font-weight: bold">
			Do you have directions to the gym?
		</p>
		<p class="main-text-format"  style="margin-bottom: 25px">
From Hwy 151, go east on Reiner Rd, turn right on O'Keeffe Ave, left on Cremer Dr., right on Capitol Dr., right on Terra Ct., and we are at the end of the cul-de-sac.		</p>
