"Back Handspring Clinic - Monday, June 29, 1-2pm - $20",
"Looking to finally get your back handspring or improve the handspring you already have? Attend this workshop for a better understanding of the back handspring and how to do it with good form.  Students should already be able to do a back bend kickover or back walkover.",
"Back Tuck Clinic - Thursday, July 2nd, 3-4pm - $20",
"If you already have a back handspring, come to this clinic to work on back tucks. A back tuck is the first back flip that is learned in gymnastics. Once this is mastered, students can start to learn back layouts and other types of flipping."]
