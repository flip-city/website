			"answer" : "Yes.  Students may attend one class before enrolling.  Afterward, to register for class, you will pay that month's tuition.  If you choose not to register, you will owe nothing.  Please note: Signing up for a trial class will not hold a spot for your child at that particular class time.  To reserve a spot, please pay the first month's tuition.  If you decide to discontinue enrollment within 3 weeks, we will refund tuition paid."

			"question" : "When and how should I make payment?",
			"answer" : "The first month's tuition is due at the time of registration.  Thereafter, tuition is due on the first of the month.  If tuition has not been paid by the 7th of the month, a $10 late fee will be charged.  After the 15th of the month, the student will be dropped from class and a spot will be given to a student on the waitlist."
